3 new equations to estimate GFR

This package contains 3 equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using serum creatinine, age and sex: the MFP Scr equation, the GAM Scr equation and the RF Scr equation.

1. mfp_egfr. The mfp_egfr function was created to facilitate estimation of GFR using the MFP Scr equation, which was developed using a multivariate fractional polynomial model.
2. gam_egfr. The gam_egfr function was created to facilitate estimation of GFR using the GAM Scr equation, which was developed using a generalized additive model.
3. rf_egfr. The gam_egfr function was created to facilitate estimation of GFR using the RF Scr equation, which was developed using a Random Forest model.
